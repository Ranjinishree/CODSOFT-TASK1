The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various features. This classification problem utilizes a well-known dataset containing details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more. The objective is to preprocess the data, engineer meaningful features, and train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to classify passengers as survived (1) or not survived (0). The dataset includes attributes such as Passenger ID, Name, Age, Gender, Ticket Class, Fare, Number of Siblings/Spouses and Parents/Children aboard, Cabin, and Embarkation Port. The workflow involves data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and missing values, preprocessing to handle missing data and encode categorical features, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
